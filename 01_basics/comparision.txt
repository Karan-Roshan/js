The reason is that equality checks (==) and comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=) behave differently in JavaScript.

When using comparison operators, JavaScript converts null to a number, and null becomes 0.
That’s why:
	•	null >= 0 → true (because 0 >= 0)
	•	null > 0 → false (because 0 > 0 is false)

However, equality checks (==) do not follow the same conversion rules.
So:
	•	null == 0 → false

This inconsistency is why comparisons involving null can be confusing and error-prone in JavaScript.
