Q.  Why we can't use var?
Ans:    1. JavaScript is used on millions of old websites written before ES6 (2015).
        2. Function Scope Behavior: var is function-scoped, not block-scoped.
            function test() {
                var x = 10;
            }
            console.log(x); // Error
        3. Hoisting Use Cases: var is hoisted and initialized as undefined.
            console.log(a); // undefined
            var a = 5;


Q.  Is it possible to declare and initialize a variable in JavaScript without using var, let, or const? 
    If yes, how? Why is it not a good practice?
Ans:    Yes,it is possible in JS.
        When a variable is assigned a value without using var, let, or const, JavaScript automatically creates a global variable.
            Example:
                x = 10;   // variable created without declaration keyword
                console.log(x);
        Here, JavaScript reserves memory, declares, and initializes the variable automatically.

        It is not a good practice because this can lead to unexpected bugs, overwrite existing variables, make debugging difficult, and pollute the global scope.
        It also breaks clean coding standards and is not allowed in strict mode.


Q.    Why do JavaScript programs work even when semicolons are not used?
Ans:    JavaScript has a feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI), which allows the program to work even if semicolons are not written.
        However, using semicolons is a good practice to avoid unexpected errors.
