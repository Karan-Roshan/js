## About This Repository
This repository contains my complete learning journey of JavaScript –  
from beginner concepts to advanced topics, including internal working of JavaScript.

I am learning from the "Chai Aur JavaScript" playlist by Hitesh Choudhary  
and documenting everything I learn through code examples and detailed notes.
